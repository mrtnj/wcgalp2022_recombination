	abstract = {Allele substitution effects at quantitative trait loci (QTL) are part of the basis of quantitative genetics theory and applications such as association analysis and genomic prediction. In the presence of nonadditive functional gene action, substitution effects are not constant across populations. We develop an original approach to model the difference in substitution effects across populations as a first order Taylor series expansion from a “focal” population. This expansion involves the difference in allele frequencies and second-order statistical effects (additive by additive and dominance). The change in allele frequencies is a function of relationships (or genetic distances) across populations. As a result, it is possible to estimate the correlation of substitution effects across two populations using three elements: magnitudes of additive, dominance, and additive by additive variances; relationships (Nei’s minimum distances or Fst indexes); and assumed heterozygosities. Similarly, the theory applies as well to distinct generations in a population, in which case the distance across generations is a function of increase of inbreeding. Simulation results confirmed our derivations. Slight biases were observed, depending on the nonadditive mechanism and the reference allele. Our derivations are useful to understand and forecast the possibility of prediction across populations and the similarity of GWAS effects.},

Here, we investigated the long-term effects of genomic selection on response to selection, genetic variance, and the genetic architecture of traits using stochastic simulations. We defined the genetic architecture as the set of causal loci underlying each trait, their allele frequencies, and their statistical additive effects. We simulated a livestock population under 50 generations of phenotypic, pedigree, or genomic selection for a single trait, controlled by either only additive, additive and dominance, or additive, dominance, and epistatic effects. The simulated epistasis was based on yeast data.},

	abstract = {The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population genetic insights outpaced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous nonadaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.},

AlphaSimR is a highly flexible software package able to simulate a wide range of plant and animal breeding programs for diploid and autopolyploid species. AlphaSimR is ideal for testing the overall strategy and detailed design of breeding programs. AlphaSimR utilizes a scripting approach to building simulations that is particularly well suited for modeling highly complex breeding programs, such as commercial breeding programs. The primary benefit of this scripting approach is that it frees users from preset breeding program designs and allows them to model nearly any breeding program design. This paper lists the main features of AlphaSimR and provides a brief example simulation to show how to use the software.},

	abstract = {Individuals of a specified pedigree relationship vary in the proportion of the genome they share identical by descent, i.e. in their realised or actual relationship. Predictions of the variance in realised relationship have previously been based solely on the proportion of the map length shared, which requires the implicit assumption that both recombination rate and genetic information are uniformly distributed along the genome. This ignores the possible existence of recombination hotspots, and fails to distinguish between coding and non-coding sequences. In this paper, we therefore quantify the effects of heterogeneity in recombination rate at broad and fine-scale levels on the variation in realised relationship. Variance is usually greater on a chromosome with a non-uniform recombination rate than on a chromosome with the same map length and uniform recombination rate, especially if recombination rates are higher towards chromosome ends. Reductions in variance can also be obtained, however, and the overall pattern of change is quite complex. In general, local (fine-scale) variation in recombination rate, e.g. hotspots, has a small influence on the variance in realised relationship. Differences in rates across longer regions and between chromosome ends can increase or decrease the variance in a realised relationship, depending on the genomic architecture.},
